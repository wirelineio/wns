## Record Types

- WNS is a decentralized database that contains typed record.
- Each record has a type field which conforms to a defined set of Record Schema (defined as protocol buffers).
    - ISSUE: Today we don't have type-specific protobuf definitions (just defacto key-value properties).
    - ISSUE: Is this a flat namespace (e.g., 'service') or user extensible? (ANSWER: Today it's flat).
    - ISSUE: Where are these protobufs defined (ANSWER: Today in WNS code; extensible only by WNS developers/governance).
- There are a small subset of these types.
    - TODO: List them in a table (service, bot, app, pad, kube, protocol, etc.)
    - The purpose of the `type` is to designate platform-specific characteristics of components within the network.
      (i.e., it is not arbitrarily extensible).

The following sections describe the different platform record types.

### Protocols

- Protocol records contain protocol buffer type and service definitions and other meta data.
- These describe data and service interfaces that determine how components within the network interoperate.

### Services

- The Service schema contains a `protocols` field that is an array of WRN references that reference Protocol records.
  Example: The BotFactory service defines a service protocol for spawning bots.
- Services records may also contain fields that define other aspects of the service
  (E.g., identity, contracts, SLAs, etc.)
- Service run within a KUBE container, which provides access to other network services and capabilities
  (E.g., identity/crypto wallets).
  NOTE: Services are roughly analogous to the Kubernetes concept of a (Pod)[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/].
  A KUBE Node is a virtual machine that is equivalent to a Kubernetes (Node)[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/].
  Devices that support KUBE Nodes are also known as KUBEs; these devices may be physical (e.g., Pi, NUC) or virtual (e.g., KUBE machine).
